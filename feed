		<description><![CDATA[<h2>Looking for the top-rated Roofing service in Lewes Delaware  </h2><p><br /><br /><br /><br />Over the past 20 years, Pro-Exteriors Roofing has built a reputation as the first choice of homeowners for <a href="https://sussexpros.z13.web.core.windows.net/Roofing-Lewes-DE/Roofing-in-Lewes-Delaware-neighborhoods.html">roofing companies in Lewes Delaware</a> and the surrounding areas. We are proud to provide quality roofing installations to our communities, while using the best materials available. We’re Delaware natives and our team understands that all of our homes need high-quality roofs to stay strong through our unpredictable seasons. Our experienced roofers treat every job and every home as if it were their own. If you need the help of a roofer for a new roof, whether is has been damaged by storms, or simply worn down over time, call a roofer you can trust to give a straightforward quote. In addition to providing roofing services, we also provide siding and guttering work. With Pro-Exteriors , you can be sure that you are getting the best and most professional home improvement services. Improperly installed or sub-standard roofing can lead to expensive structural problems down the road. This is why you should put this kind of project in the hands of experienced professionals like us. We take care for your home as if it is our own, and we will give each roofing job, from a basic maintenance job, to advanced work, such as finding the source of a leaking roof, the attention to detail to ensure it is done right. As a roofing service we will work with you to meet deadlines and coordinate with other related projects. Pro-Exteriors Roofing is a specialized residential roofing service that has been providing top-notch service to the Sussex County DE area for over two decades. Roofing is probably one of the most important home improvements you can make. At Pro-Exteriors we will maintain open communication with you to keep you up to date on the status of your roof job - we do this to guarantee that the project is completed according to your preferences. Install New Roofing Roof replacement services are necessary if your roof is in poor shape. It's very important to have a solid base for your roofing structure so your roof shingles will stay securely attached. Too many leaks, broken or loose roofshingles, and fungal growth can make a roof almost useless. Every single roof replacement job begins with a thorough inspection of the wood underlayment or decking, and any soft, wet or rotted wood needs to be replaced to create a solid base for your roofing structure. Don’t wait replacing your roof until there’s damage to the inner structure of your roofing and home to replace your roof and install a new roof. Full replacement, when you opt for a tear-off roofing job, means your new roof will be just that: new. In a total roof replacement, it will be as if it were a brand new roof, which has a lot of benefits. If you had any rotted decking or leaks in your roof, they’ll be gone with the new roof install. Since the roofers have to take off all of the shingles in a complete roof replacement, they get a clear look into what’s going on with your roof, so the finished product will be almost perfect. Contact Pro Exteriors Roofing today to get top of the line care for your home. Pro-Exteriors offers a wide range of options specific to each individual roofing project including your choice of material, guttering, color, coatings &amp; insulation. Getting a new roof will benefit you for the long-term, protecting your home for many years and boosting your home’s resale value. We have an expert team dedicated to roof instalation work which is focused on ensuring everything about your new roofing - from your choice of colors and materials to the quality of the workmanship - is to your satisfaction. <br /><br /><br />Check out this Roofing video</p><p><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9" align="center"><iframe  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FWXnfb_IM1s" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div></p><p>&amp;nbsp;</p><p><iframe width="100%" height="340" frameborder="0" style="border:0"  src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/search?q=Roofing Lewes Delaware  &amp;key=AIzaSyDBe0H0GZ20MlzkCc6S8wz9YtEK9vxX6f0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>&amp;nbsp;</p><h3>Your local Roofing in Lewes Delaware <a href="http://BSW main~sussex-pros.s3-website.GH.amazonaws.com/Roofing-Lewes-DE/Roofing-in-Lewes-Delaware.html">Roofing in Lewes Delaware  </a></h3>]]></description>
